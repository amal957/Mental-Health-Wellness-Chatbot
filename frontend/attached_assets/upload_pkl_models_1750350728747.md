# How to Upload Your PKL Models

To use your trained emotion detection models, please upload the following files to the project root directory:

## Required Files:
1. **emotion_model.pkl** - Your trained emotion classification model (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)
2. **emotion_vectorizer.pkl** - Your TF-IDF vectorizer 
3. **label_encoder.pkl** - Your label encoder for emotion classes

## Upload Instructions:
1. Rename your files to match the expected names above
2. Upload them directly to the project root folder
3. The system will automatically detect and load them

## Current Status:
- The uploaded files appear to be corrupted or truncated
- The system is currently using fallback emotion detection with keyword matching
- Once valid PKL files are uploaded, the system will automatically switch to using your trained models

## Supported Model Types:
- Scikit-learn models (LogisticRegression, SVM, etc.)
- TF-IDF Vectorizers
- Label Encoders
- Models saved with pickle or joblib

The emotion detector will automatically validate the models and provide detailed logging about the loading process.
