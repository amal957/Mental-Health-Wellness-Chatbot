# This is a placeholder file since we cannot generate the actual ML model pickle file.
# The application's ml_utils.py is already designed to handle missing model files gracefully
# by falling back to rule-based emotion detection.

# To use a real trained model, you would need to:
# 1. Train a TF-IDF vectorizer + Logistic Regression model on emotion-labeled text data
# 2. Save it using joblib.dump() with the following structure:
#
# import joblib
# from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
# from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
# from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
# 
# # After training your model:
# model_data = {
#     'vectorizer': tfidf_vectorizer,
#     'model': logistic_regression_model,
#     'label_encoder': label_encoder
# }
# joblib.dump(model_data, 'tfidf_logreg_emotion_1750350595249.pkl')

# For now, the application will use the fallback emotion detection system
# which provides basic keyword-based emotion classification.

print("This is a placeholder for the ML model pickle file.")
print("The application will use fallback emotion detection.")
